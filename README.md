# ⭐ Disposable Chatroom Project - Team 74 ⭐

Our team, Team 74, developed a disposable chatroom using Svelte and the GunDB library. Users can enter a room name and a username to join a chat room. Within the chat room, users can send messages, delete messages, and, at the end, any user can dispose of the room by clicking the delete button.

## See our chat app preview at 🪼 [CraftChat on Vercel](https://craftchat-seven.vercel.app/)

## This project was made by our team for [DevStar](https://github.com/nav9v/devstar)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
